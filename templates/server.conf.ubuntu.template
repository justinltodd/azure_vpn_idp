# Set OpenVPN major mode. By default, OpenVPN runs in point-to-point mode (“p2p”).
# OpenVPN 2.0 introduces a new mode (“server”) which implements a multi-client server capability.

#Enable TLS and assume server role during TLS handshake. OpenVPN is designed as a peer-to-peer application.

#If client-to-client is enabled, the VPN server forwards client-to-client packets internally
#without sending them to the IP layer of the host (i.e. to the kernel). The host networking
#stack does not see those packets at all.

#The algorithm parameter may be "lzo", "lz4", or empty. LZO and LZ4 are different compression

#For backwards compatibility with OpenVPN versions before v2.4, use "lzo" (which is identical
#to the older option "--comp-lzo yes").
